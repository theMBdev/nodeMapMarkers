### What is this

Its a web application that lets users view the location of land marks on a world map. The users browse the map and can click on a marker to see photos of what's there. The user can submit new locations and photos to the map after signing up. Each submission has to be verified by the site admin before it is added.

### Why was it built

Built to practice with node js. Having built a blog in node js before this i wanted to build something new and a little more complex. I had worked with maps before so decided to create a project that would combine maps with node. Last time I worked with maps I used google maps so this time i used another provider (leaflet/mapbox).
